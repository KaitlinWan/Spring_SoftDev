'''
Our json dataset is "laureates". It is a complete list of people who have
obtained a Novel Prize in any category as well as information regarding
their birth and deaths, education, places lived, etc. It also includes information
about the nature of their prizes as well as the year they won and how many they won
Our collection came from http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/laureate.json
We opened the file downloaded from the api, named laureate.json, and then inserted
it into our new collection after loading it
